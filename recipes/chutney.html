      Tomato Chutney is a Chutney variety from Indian cuisine, made primarily
      with fresh ripe tomatoes. Various spices and fresh herbs are used to
      flavor up and balance the tang & sweetness of the ripe tomatoes. Tomato
      Chutney is made in various regions of India so the preparations vary
      widely. Each family may have a different recipe made to suit their taste &
      liking. While there are sweet and spicy chutneys, this hot, tangy and
      spicy chutney belongs to South Indian cuisine & is a staple. Traditionally
      Tomato Chutney was made by crushing roasted tomatoes, garlic, chilies,
      tamarind, cumin seeds and salt in a mortar pestle. Nothing else was added
      to it. However home cooks have been innovative overtime and now it is made
      in many ways.
